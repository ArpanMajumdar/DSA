# Problem

# Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the treeâ€™s diameter. The diameter of a binary tree is the 
# length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

# Solution
# - Start with the assumption that the diameter is 0.
# - Calculate the diameter of the left sub-tree and right sub-tree of the root node using the following recursive process:
#   - At a leaf node, the diameter and height with respect to its children is 0 and 1, respectively.
#   - For a non-leaf node, calculate the heights as well as the diameters of the left and right sub-trees. If the diameter 
#     passes through this node, then the diameter is the sum of the heights of the two sub-trees. 
#     Otherwise, it is the greater of the diameters of the two sub-trees.
# - Update the diameter as the greater of two values:
#   - the sum of the heights of the left and right sub-trees,
#   - the greater of the diameters of the two sub-trees.
